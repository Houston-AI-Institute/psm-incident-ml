# psm-incident-ml — conventions

Public, reproducible dataset + baseline models for process-safety incident
investigation ML. Source: US federal offshore incident reports (BSEE).
Target schema: Energy Institute PSM Framework **Element 19** (Incident Reporting
& Investigation).

Audience is a public hackathon. **Every claim this repo makes about data
provenance must be checkable by a stranger.**

## Column provenance prefixes — the single most important convention

Every column in every processed table carries its origin in the name, because
this project deliberately mixes real and generated data.

| Prefix  | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `src_`  | extracted verbatim from a BSEE PDF or CSV |
| `xw_`   | deterministic crosswalk from a `src_` field via `schema/crosswalk.yaml` |
| `llm_`  | assigned by a model — never treated as ground truth |
| `gold_` | assigned by a human — the only thing you may score against |
| `syn_`  | fully generated, corresponds to nothing real |

A column with no prefix is a bug — **except in the E19 output tables, where it is
required.** See below.

### The E19 tables carry provenance in a parallel file, not in the name

`data/processed/e19/*.csv` must carry the source workbook's field labels
**byte-exact**, including its own irregularities: `Incident Classificatioin`
(sic), ` Failed PSM Framework Element` (leading space), `What happened?  `
(trailing spaces). Prefixing them would break the exactness guarantee the whole
projection layer exists to provide, so the prefix rule is suspended there and
provenance moves to a **parallel file of identical shape** — every cell holding
`src`, `xw` or empty:

```
enriched/incidents.csv        the values, under exact E19 labels
enriched/provenance.csv       same shape; per-cell src / xw / empty
enriched/causes_provenance.csv
enriched/causes_confidence.csv   per-cell confidence where a mapping is graded
```

This is **stronger** than a prefix, not a concession. A prefix labels a whole
column; the parallel file labels every cell — and the same E19 column is read
verbatim on one row and inferred on another, which a column-level prefix cannot
express.

The prefix rule still applies everywhere the exactness constraint does not:
`synth.py` output, the sidecar (`bsee_*`), and the interim records (`src_f*`).

`tests/test_conventions.py` enforces both halves: prefixes where they apply, and
for the E19 tables that a provenance file exists with matching shape, that its
tokens come from a closed set, that no non-empty cell lacks a provenance, and
that **`xw` never overwrote a verbatim value**.

## The crosswalk is data, not code

`schema/crosswalk.yaml` encodes an *opinion* about how BSEE cause categories map
to EI PSM elements. It will be argued with. Keep it readable in one screen,
version it, and **never bury a mapping in a Python dict.**

## The `xw_`/`syn_` boundary

`xw_` requires an external, independently published source (today:
`schema/crosswalk.yaml`'s BSEE-category -> EI element mapping). A `synth.py`
rule may take a real BSEE convention as *inspiration* for a threshold's shape
(e.g. picking a round dollar figure BSEE itself uses as an order-of-magnitude
reference) without qualifying as `xw_` — inspiration is not sourcing. Every
`src/psm/synth.py` output is `syn_`, full stop, even when it's derived from a
real `src_` column, because the *mapping* (which tier a value falls into) is
our own invented judgment, not an external authority's.

## Never report a metric scored against `llm_` columns

Accuracy against model-generated labels measures agreement with the labeller,
not correctness. Score against `gold_` only, and always state n.

---

## Extraction rules (learned the hard way — do not regress)

**1. Text-stream order ≠ visual order.** In sampled MMS Form 2010 PDFs the field
label `18. LIST THE PROBABLE CAUSE(S)` appears *after* its own content in the
extracted text stream. Pre-2021 reports linearize as interleaved two-column soup
where checkbox `X` marks detach from their labels entirely:

```
1. OCCURRED
X
X STRUCTURAL DAMAGE
DATE: 17-OCT-2020 TIME: 0445 HOURS CRANE
```

Use **coordinate-aware extraction** (`pdfplumber`, bbox) and reconstruct fields
by position. `pypdf` / naive `extract_text()` produces confidently wrong labels.
Do not use the `pdf` skill's text path for field assignment.

**2. Empty ≠ parse failure.** Some reports have genuinely blank fields 18/19
(e.g. SP 57-B Cox, Oct 2020 — third-party vessel allision outside BSEE
jurisdiction). Every record carries an explicit `src_cause_status`:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `typed` | controlled-vocabulary category present in field 18/19 |
| `freetext` | prose present, no controlled category |
| `absent_legitimate` | field present and genuinely empty |
| `parse_failed` | could not locate or read the field |

Conflating these sends you chasing phantom bugs and silently dropping valid
records.

**3. Source data is dirty and stays dirty.** One report dates its onsite
investigation `29-JUN-0202`. Log anomalies to `data/interim/anomalies.jsonl`;
do not silently repair them.

## Reproducibility contract

`data/raw/` is gitignored. `data/manifest.csv` is **committed**, with a SHA256
per file, so anyone can rebuild byte-identical inputs from a fresh clone.

Committed: `data/manifest.csv`, `data/processed/*.csv` (<10MB), `gold/`, `schema/`.
Gitignored: `data/raw/`, `data/interim/`.

## Do not commit

- `E19 Investigation Report - Rev2.xlsx` — a workplace document. The workbook was provided by the Energy track's challenge partner, who gave permission to publish its field labels, picklist vocabularies and cell references (`schema/e19_labels.yaml`) in this public repository. The labels are not confidential. The workbook file itself is not committed.
  `schema/e19_labels.yaml` was extracted mechanically from the workbook
  (`src/psm/e19_schema.py`, commit bc84583); `schema/e19_target.yaml` is
  hand-written. Permitted derivative: `schema/e19_labels.yaml` only. Nothing else
  derived from the workbook (formulas, scoring, rollups, the file itself) is committed.
- Exception (2026-10-25): `schema/xw_consequence_tiers.yaml` keeps the workbook's three classification bands (21+, 11-20, 1-10), and the team bundle ships it. Owner decision; no other workbook scoring is committed.
- Exception (2026-10-19): `cause_task.csv` baselines may report agreement with `src_category`/`xw_element`, worded as recovery of the investigator's category, not PSM-element correctness, always with n. No other non-gold scoring.
- EI PSM Framework element *names* may be referenced with attribution (they are
  published by the Energy Institute); the workbook, its formulas, and its
  rollup dashboards may not.
