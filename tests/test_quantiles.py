    # CDF -- no correct implementation of analytic_overdue_rate can clear
    # 3x here). The brief's "3x" appears to have been carried over from the
    # *measured*, full-pipeline overdue_rate KPI row in

    # not this isolated two-point analytic check; the neighboring

    # factor 2.0, which this ratio clears with margin. See task-4-report.md.
