"""Single source of truth for provenance tokens, fill colours, and the
column->token classification rule.

Token semantics (About-sheet legend must match):
  ""     cell is empty
  src    verbatim from a BSEE source document
  xw     deterministic crosswalk of a BSEE category (schema/crosswalk.yaml)
  llm    assigned by a language model, never ground truth
  gold   human-labelled ground truth (never written by code)
  syn    synthetic: deterministic hash-generated filler, no real referent
  key    constructed join identifier. The whole Incident Number column is
         built by this repo (AREA-BLOCK-YYYYMMDD-HHMM composites, some with
         UNKEYED-/collision hash parts); BSEE publishes no incident id.
         Classified BY COLUMN, not by string pattern -- pattern-matching
         INV-/SUP-/UNKEYED- substrings undercounts by ~850 cells.
  pseud  salted pseudonym of a real value (INV-/SUP- name tokens: stable
         privacy transforms of real people's names -- de-amplification,
         not fabrication; epistemically distinct from both src and key).
  mod    real source text that this project altered: dates shifted, or a
         company name, person name or contact detail masked; otherwise
         verbatim. May only replace src.
