"""Export the filled/ E19 layer to one xlsx for SME review.

Five sheets: About (what this is and is not), Incidents, Causes, Incidents
Provenance, Causes Provenance. Every cell whose provenance token is
xw/llm/syn/key/pseud carries a fill colour on the data sheets so a reviewer
can see at a glance which values are real, mapped, model-assigned, synthetic,
a constructed identifier, or a pseudonym (legend on the About sheet). Colour
does not survive copy/paste, CSV export, or an AI analyst reading the file,
so the two Provenance sheets mirror the data sheets cell-for-cell with the
plain-text token instead of a fill -- provenance that travels with the data
even once the colours are gone. Header cells on the data sheets also carry a
comment with per-column token counts and meanings, for the same reason. The
workbook is a DELIVERABLE, not a dataset of record — deliverables/ is
gitignored; the committed record is data/processed/e19/filled/*.csv plus the
parallel provenance files.
